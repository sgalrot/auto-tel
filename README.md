# auto-tel
We took the Auto-tel car rental services dataset and tried estimating the total usage time from various inputs, including the beggining and end coordinate. The total time is the actual parameter from which the charging is derived, which is a key parameter for the user, taking into account the very problematic issue of parking in Tel-Aviv area.

Although there are reserved parking for the service, sometimes the reserved parkings are already taken, especially in rush hours when some other non Auto-Tel cars take the liberty of parking in those reserved places not legitimately.

The estimation takes into account all scenarios since the dataset includes all cases.
